  <h1>Introducing myself to<span> Ping Pong</span></h1>
  <p>I am a beginner to this sport. When I moved to Missouri in April of 2016,
    I found a new love of mine: <span>Ping Pong</span>. Nested in the basement of my
    girlfriend's parent's house, was a <span>ping pong</span> table. It was inconspicuous, but seemed
    to call to me. I picked up the paddle and proceeded to badger my girlfriend for a
    quick rally (to hit the ball back and forth for fun). She agreed, and several
    minutes later I found myself embarking on a lifelong journey.
    <h2>Challenges, Joy, and Defeat</h2>
    <p>My first steps into <span>Ping Pong</span> were a strange mix of childlike excitement and
      the staggering realization that I was outclassed. My girlfriend and her brother
      were my main adversaries, and growing up with a <span>ping pong</span> table has had an
      obvious effect on them!</p>
    <h4>As a beginner, I faced many problems that forced me to adapt and overcome:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Getting a Grip:</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Trying to figure out which hand to hold the paddle was surprisingly
          difficult. I began using my left hand, but ultimately switched to my
          right, and found that my control was much better.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Staying on the Table:</li>

      <ul>
        <li>One of my biggest downfalls is position and power: the two P's that
          are fundamental to a good hit. Position determines where you aim the ball,
          and power determines how much force you put into the hit. In my case, many
          hits were either not making it past the net, or going completely off the table.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
